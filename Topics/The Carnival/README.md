 * A carnival game, try to win the best prizes and try not to hit the sad clowns, game ends when health bar is low or timer ends.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * - Move the gun with your mouse
    * - Click to launch the spray, press and hold for a longer reach
        * - Hit the targets, avoid the sad clowns, happy clowns are worth more
            * sad clowns remove - 10 health and - 5 points
                * happy clowns add health back! And add 3 points
                    * Two levels of prizes to be won, a bear or a cuddly clown. 
 * The bear wins for under 50 points(consider it a participation gift!)
    * The cuddly clown wins for over 50 points
        * Again, if the healthbar hits 0 its game over
            *
