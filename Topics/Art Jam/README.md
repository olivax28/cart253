## Description

This is a simple program where the user controls a goldfish with a mouse. A fish food pebble drops from the top right corner, landing on the sand. A timer 
is set up so that the water gets polluted over time by the food, turning pink.
The user is able to move the goldfish on top of the food pellet, where they mustmove the goldfish in a circular "eating motion."
 
The goldfish then gets bigger and redder until it eats too much and dies,cutting off input from the mouse and turning grey.

Goldfish are known to eat too much, they're very voracious eaters. Perhaps this one has more of a commentary on the inevitability on death in videogames despite
the ability to gain coins, points, etc.
